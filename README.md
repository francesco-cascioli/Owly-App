# 🦉 Owly - Book Discovery App for Primary Education

**Owly** is a web application developed as part of an educational project to promote reading among children in primary schools.  
It uses the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) to allow users to search books by category, view titles and authors, and read full descriptions.

This project simulates a real-world development task and was built from scratch using JavaScript, Webpack, and other modern tools.
